Audrey Jean Hayward (nee Banerd) 1934 -- 2021
passed peacefully on April 23 at Royal Columbia Hospital in
New Westminster, attended by family
and with the sounds of birdsong in the room.
She is survived by her husband of 63 years Herbert,
siblings Blanche, Adair, and Dolores,
sons Ryan (Liz) and Owen (Sandra), and 
grandchildren Annie, Emily, Courtenay, Sophia, and Tyrone.

Born in Kipling, Saskatchewan,
she later moved with her family to Vancouver.
She attended John Oliver High School
and UBC (B.A. 1956, Sociology and Geography).
She led a full life dedicated to family and friends.
She attended the Lutheran Church and volunteered regularly 
at the Coast Mental Health Foundation in Vancouver.

She played softball and loved drawing birds and plants.
She was a fan of her children and doted on her grandchildren,
guiding their artistic development through arts and crafts,
and encouraging the development of their baseball skills.
In later years she enjoyed sitting on the porch,
taking in the sights and sounds of the neighbourhood.

A neighour described her like this:
quirky, funny, thoughtul, deep;
a real character, a joy to know, to share a quick laugh, a hearty hello.
She travelled to Paris, Bonn, and New Jersey to visit her family.
She had great empathy for those less fortunate.
She was ever-curious, especially with respect to the latest developments
in psychology and mental health.
