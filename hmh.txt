Herbert Medwyn Hayward 1933 -- 2023 passed on March 30 in Osoyoos, predeceased by wife Audrey (nee Banerd) of 63 years, survived by sons Ryan (Liz) and Owen (Sandra) and grandchildren Annie, Ember, Courtenay, Sophia, and Tyrone.

A dedicated husband, father, and grandfather, Herb lived with grace, dignity and humility, never seeking the limelight, enthusiastically supporting his wife, children and grandchildren.

Born in Lethbridge, as a teen Herb moved with his family to Vancouver. He attended John Oliver High School and UBC, graduating as a mechanical engineer in 1956. He joined the BC Sugar Company soon after. A career company man, he started in the drafting room and retired as Vice-President of Operations.

As a youth, Herb won many singing competitions, leading to a life-long passion for choir. He also enjoyed sports.  He played football for UBC and also enjoyed baseball, hockey, basketball, volleyball, tennis, soccer and curling. Wherever and whenever an opportunity arose for him to attend one of his son's or grandchild's activities, he was there.

A man of his generation, he was a talented builder, carpenter, handyman and artist. He researched and planned all projects, usually starting with a pencil and his pad of graph paper.

Slowed by a stroke in 2019, Herb spent his final years at Mariposa Gardens in Osoyoos, enjoying the warmth and sunshine while overlooking the orchards and mountains of the south Okanagan.
