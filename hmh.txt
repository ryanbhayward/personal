Herbert Medwyn Hayward 1933 -- 2023 passed on March 30 in Osoyoos. 
He is predeceased by his wife Audrey (nee Banerd) of 63 years
and survived by sons Ryan (Liz) and and Owen (Sandra) and 
grandchildren Annie, Ember, Courtenay, Sophia, and Tyrone.
Slowed by a stroke in 2019, Herb spent his final years 
in comfort at Mariposa Gardens in Osoyoos, 
enjoying the warmth and sunshine of the Okanogan.

A dedicated husband, father, grandfather and company man, 
Herb lived with grace, dignity and humility.
He never sought the limelight but was ever-present
in the lives of his wife, children and grandchildren.

Born in Lethbridge, Herb moved with his family to Vancouver,
where he attended John Oliver High School and UBC.
He graduated from UBC as a mechanical engineer in 1956.
Shortly after he joined the BC Sugar Company,
where he rose through the ranks, eventually retiring as
Vice-President of Operations in Vancouver.

Herb enjoyed sports,
and was a faithful fan of 
his family's baseball, hockey, basketball, tennis, soccer and curling events.
As a youth he won many singing competitions.
He carried that passion into adult life, from listening
to recordings of the Welsh Men's Choirs to 
his Annie's choir recitals at UBC.
Truly a man of his generation, 
Herb more than capably did most things himself and was a talented builder/carpenter/handyman/artist; 
always researching and thoroughly planning his endeavours, 
usually starting with a pencil and his pad of graph paper

A memorial gathering will take place at New Brighton Park
on Saturday April 22.

In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation to 
cancer research, Parkinson's research, or your favorite charity.
