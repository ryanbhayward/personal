Annie had visited Gma and Gpa March 3
(week before Gma had called,
wanted A to come and pick up her xmas present)

Gma Gpa A sat in the driveway on folding chairs
(CO detector) apologetic that it was such a practical gift:
had woken up one morning, feeling groggy, and the detector
was going off,
chatted about getting Covid vaccine...

March 20, had been thinking about helping Gma get the vaccine,
long visit, sitting outside, chatting about vaccines,
Gpa got cold and went inside,
A called Brentwood Medical Center: did they have records
from 1973 when Mom had had a bad reaction,
made an appointment to get a referral to see an allergist

next time A heard from her,
voicemail heard from Em about Horitos pop drink.
(right after Gpa heads to Penticton).

* holding my hand
* I love love love you (difficult speech)
* going from weird story of 1st day (a story you're not going to want to hear,
dad not showering)
  to being surprised to being at Royal Columbian to
  the conversation when I told her about the house,
  things were still good, they were building a house across
  the street, she shrugged, like what could you do
