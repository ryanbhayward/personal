- sitting in back yard watching cats :)
- recap: knee injury worse, can't walk! hobbling, physio, awesome:
  gout+knee injury, gout under control, diet started (down 2 pounds),
  will no longer eat dinner, 

- L down east to visit Nancy, driver's license expired, all's well that ends well
- saw dad 2 days then picked up Em at K, 3 days E+R+dad, went better than expected,
  D has awesome care aid, he's in good hands, 
  ideal is when they let him sleep until 11, I come by then
  (once with me, once with me/Em out to lunch, toileting before we leave)
  sad when I leave, but because I don't like being far from DAE when they need me
- visit dad about 8 days/month, but takes up about 2 weeks/month of my energy
- challenge is finding work/family balance
- satisfying trip with dad, long drive back, exhausted, L not happy I don't eat dinner

- retire? reapply for grant?  MM will pay for grad students :)  will help with grant app
  problem: I still can't be bothered to read (ADHD?)
  mathematician's dream: work on math problems, but don't write them up
- fall semester? how to lesson muy work load
