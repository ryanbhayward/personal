Tue Apr 21 2020... time to start a diary...

dream last night in Iceland with Yngvi, he left me his jacket,
like the bearskin in Revenant, on the edge of water,
at one point a fire starts in the water just offshore (volcanic),
later on, you could see thru the water to below, very deep,
underwater forests (kelpish), with strange animals (dinosaur like),
swimming mostly around-between the foresty bits

walking along some kind of festival, with free food (cuts of meat)
occasionally left on the ground for people to help themselves to,
then , people would cut off strips with a knife,
as I was walking somehow this pole over my shoulder holding a bag
snagged someone's bathing suit, so I was worried I wouldn't be able
to return it to where I snagged, that I would have stolen the suit

bball dream, playing for a high school team,
the usual confusion about how this would be
allwed was that it was a tournament...
but then in the hallway before the game, seeing opponents,
all 6'6 etc, wondering how I can possibly compete..
my mom at the game near the bench, lying down sleeping on some
kind of cot, explain to her that she can't be sleeping 
on the sidelines at the game


* older dreams:  (last fall) heading home, I live in a green house,
the person (people?) who live there will be really happy to 
see me when I get home
