he opened his bedroom door and smelt it right away.
goddammit, the last thing he needed was a toilet that wasn't working.
or was it the sump pump? maybe some animal had fallen into
the overflow trap and drowned.

he opened all the windows downstairs.
the smell disappeared quickly.
he sank into bed, sleep came quickly.

the next morning the smell was back.
he recognized it now, from when he used to trap
mice, and sometimes he wouldn't check the traps every day,
until suddenly

it took him 24 hours, but eventually he found it:
a dead body, starting to decay, already bloated.
and the smell ... of course it wasn't the toilet,
the smell was sharper, more sour. a dead body,
and someone had left it in his closet.
