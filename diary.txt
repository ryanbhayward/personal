* what a day: 0800 zoom w Stefan,
  stil on early parts of the p4-structure paper,
  continued longer than usual, fun, baby steps
* had to rush to uni to make my 11:30 at
  Filistix w Kevin (touring cyclist),
  turns out he's happily non-meat eater
  we both enjoyed the moroccan eggplant 
  veggie special of the week
* 2pm outdoor mtg with Abram just back
  from BC, walked to Redbike to put air
  in his bike tires, had a latte (him)
  and hot choco (me) and surprise surprise
  bumped into Liz (this town's not big
  enough for the 2 of us) and Monica,
  we all had a good laugh
* prepped for 3pm online mtg w Owen R
  by reviewing the nonogram paper,
  we finished and submitted our review
  during the meeting
* home around 5pm, leftover onion/cauli/potato/chicken
  soup, too much better-than-bouillon,
  time to cut out unnecessary meat,
  quiet evening, L called to say that Em
  has covid poor kid, in bed by 8:30

2024 Oct 12 Sat
* looks like we had frost last night,
  so better late than never harvesting
  the last of the grapesize tomatoes
* cats have not even been outside this
  morning and they are already in their
  morning snoozing snuggled together in
  their nest by the kitchen window
* todo today(?)  tomatoes, laundry outside,
  lawn?, Dreyfus-Wagner, another ICGA review,
  make mashed, deliver mashed to L's,
  buy small tub sour cream?, market?
  hopefully contact DW (his Aunt Jean
  was in hospital and is presumably
  being moved to a care home)
